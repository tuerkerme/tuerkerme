👋 Hi, I'm @tuerkerme, an accomplished Information Security Specialist based in Germany. My expertise spans a broad spectrum of skills, making me a versatile professional in the field of cybersecurity.

🔒 As an InfoSec Specialist, I have a proven track record in Information Security Management Systems (ISMS), demonstrated by my certification as an ISO Lead Auditor for both ISO 27001 and ISO 9001. My security credentials include CompTIA Security+ and proficiency in BSI IT-Grundschutz, GDPR, and NIST frameworks.

📊 One of my key strengths lies in data analysis. With a Ph.D. in Economics, I bring a unique blend of skills in econometrics and data analysis. I leverage tools like Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. This proficiency extends beyond mere technical competence; it allows me to translate raw data into strategic business decisions.

💼 In addition to my strong foundation in risk management and cybersecurity, I excel in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and Data Loss Prevention (DLP). These skills collectively contribute to my ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical data assets.

🌐 Whether it's auditing security protocols, implementing ISMS frameworks, or utilizing my expertise in data analysis, I am well-equipped to tackle the multifaceted challenges of modern cybersecurity. I am eager to contribute my skills, particularly in data analysis, to drive actionable insights and enhance the security posture of organizations.
